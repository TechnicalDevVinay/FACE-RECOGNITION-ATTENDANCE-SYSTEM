## ðŸ§ª How It Works

1. **Register Student**
   - Capture face image via webcam
   - Store image in `student_images/` and Firebase
   - Save name, ID in Firestore

2. **Train Model**
   - Run `train_model.py`
   - Train LBPH recognizer on stored images

3. **Mark Attendance**
   - Run `main.py`
   - Recognizes faces and marks attendance in CSV & Firebase
